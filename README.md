SKI STORE FULL STACK PROJECT

For my final project at nology I used React, JavaScript, SpringBoot, Java, Intellij and mySQL. Using everything I have learnt over the course and demonstrating my ability to create a database API that is used across this user interface.

This ski store front end uses the API created by myself and displays all the skis, boots, poles, helmets and goggles. There are additional features which allows you to search through them by name and a drop down allowing you to filter by product type. 

The frontend also implements the entire CRUD system of an API allowing each product to be edited and deleted and also allowing the add product functionality.

Further work would include improving the design element of the UI and also adding testing.
